# Student Performance Factors

## Project Overview

This project aims at analysing some educational factors and it effect on students.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project was downloaded from kaggle. To access the file, click [here](https://github.com/StephenTheAnalyst/StudentPerformanceFactorsTableau/blob/main/StudentPerformanceFactors.csv)  

## Tools

 - Tableau

## Data Cleaning/Preparation

 - The 'hours_study' column had too much data, so i decided to group them into class of 8. I did sthe same for 'Attendance' column too.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

 1. How does the number of hours study affect the exam scores?

### We can see from the chart above that the more the students read, the higher the exam score. So i will say the hours of study is directly propotional to the exam score.

 2. What is the correlation between distance from home and attendance percentage.

### I did an analysis (not included here), and it showed that on average, the higher the students attendance the more they are likely to score. So i decided to analysis how distance from home affect the attendance of students. It is evidential that the closer the students are to the school, the more they attend class.

 3. How does family income and parental involvement affect the motivational level of the student?

### From the above chart, we can see that the students with the least motivational level are student with rich family background and low parental involvement... We can also conclude that students with average family income and medium parental involvement are the ones with the highest motivational level.

 4. What is the correlation of teacher quality and access to resources on students motivation level?

### According to this dataset, It is evendiential that the best combo for student motivation is an average teacher quality and an average access to resources, while the one with the least chance of boosting students motivational level is a low teacher quality and low access to resources.

## Result/Finding

### At the end of every thing, i decide to put all the visualization into a [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/VisulaizationOnStudentsPerformace/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link).... NB: There are another questuons i could have analyzied from this data, and maybe i meant do another version.
